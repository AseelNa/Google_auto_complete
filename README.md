## Description

CLI that can process big amount of data in a Trie data structure and find auto completion for the user's text and get top-k suggestions.
The system does that with preprocessing and cleaning the data from unnecessary and redundant text.
It can do 2 ways of completion:
  1. Full auto completion.
  2. Auto completion with spelling error correction:
    2.1. Substitution correction.
    2.2. Removal correction.
    2.3. Add correction.
The system searches for a completion **smartly**, only using the trie data structure, if there is no full auto completion it tries to find the most appropriate completion and then substitute the missing one, after that removing the not matched characters and at the end trying to add more characters from the trie data structure.

## How To Use

### Installation

- Copy this link ***https://github.com/loayjb96/Google_auto_complete.git*** then on cmd or bash do:

		cd ~/Desktop
		git clone {{the link you just copied}} auto-complete

- This creates a directory named "Project", clones the repository there and adds a remote named "origin" back to the source.

		cd auto-complete
		git checkout develop

- If that last command fails

		git checkout -b develop

------------
### Updating/The Development Cycle

You now have a git repository, likely with two branches: main and develop. Now bake these laws into your mind and process:

You will never commit to ***main*** or ***develop*** directly .

Instead, you will create ***feature branches*** on your machine that exist for the purpose of solving singular issues. You will always base your features off the develop branch.

		git checkout develop
		git checkout -b my-feature-branch

This last command creates a new branch named "my-feature-branch" based off of develop. You can name that branch whatever you like. You should not have to push it to Github unless you intend to work on multiple machines on that feature.

Make changes.

	git add .
	git commit -am "I have made some changes."

This adds any new files to be tracked and makes a commit. Now let's add them to develop.

	git checkout develop
	git merge --no-ff my-feature-branch
	git push origin develop
------------
### Releasing

Finished with your project?

- Create a feature branch as normal.
- Update the version history in the README.md file
- Update this to develop as normal.

		git checkout master
		git merge --no-ff develop
		git push origin master
		git tag v1.0.0
		git push origin v1.0.0
------------

### Back-end

To run locally, do the following on Backend directory:

1. Create a Python 3.5 virtualenv

2. Install dependencies:
	
```
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
npm install
```

   Alternatively, use the make task:

```
make install
```
    

in auto-complete directory you can run:

```
python main.py
```
then start to type input for the system in order to get top 5 suggestions, you can type # in order to finish the line and start new line, or #q in order to exit the program.
